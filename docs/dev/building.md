# Building and testing

## The four gates

```shell
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --release
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
```

These are exactly what
[CI](https://github.com/zbc0315/omgkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml) runs. Run them
before opening a pull request.

`cargo test --release` rather than debug: the differential tests run over a
large corpus and a debug build is too slow to be useful.

## Why `omgkit-py` is not in the default workspace members

```toml
default-members = [
    "crates/omgkit-core",
    "crates/omgkit-io",
    "crates/omgkit-chem",
    "crates/omgkit-match",
]
```

`omgkit-py` is a `cdylib` that leaves Python symbols unresolved at link time.
Building a test executable for it necessarily fails, so putting it in the
default set would turn every project-wide verification command red. It stays in
`members` so it shares the lockfile and target directory and `cargo -p` can
reach it.

## Do not add `panic = "abort"`

The Python extension relies on unwinding to catch Rust panics and turn them
into Python exceptions. With `abort`, a panic sends `SIGABRT` to the
interpreter — exit code 134, no exception, no traceback, nothing `try/except`
can catch, and the user loses their whole process along with any unsaved work.

Cargo does not allow overriding `panic` per package, so this is a workspace-wide
trade. The cost is the unwind tables and a small constant overhead, which does
not show up on the pipeline benchmark.

## The Python extension

```shell
pip install maturin
maturin build --release -m crates/omgkit-py/Cargo.toml --out dist
pip install --force-reinstall dist/omgkit-*.whl
python harness/test_python.py
```

## Differential tests

The tests come in two tiers.

**Smoke tier** — oracles are committed (about 680 KB), runs by default, green on
a fresh clone.

**Large-corpus tier** — marked `#[ignore]`, needs oracles you generate against
an external reference implementation:

```shell
cargo test --release -- --ignored
```

Generating the oracles, the column conventions for each layer, and what each
judge is guarding are documented in
[`harness/README.md`](https://github.com/zbc0315/omgkit/blob/main/harness/README.md)
— also readable here as
[the full text](correctness-full.md) (Chinese).

!!! warning "The gitignore rule for oracles is about tests, not filenames"

    Baselines that a non-`#[ignore]` test reaches must be committed, or a fresh
    clone fails immediately. Guessing by filename has gone wrong twice: once a
    rule written as `smoke.*.jsonl` excluded `smoke.matches.tsv` by suffix, once
    `smarts.jsonl` was missed because it is not named `smoke` but a non-ignored
    test hard-codes it.

    The way to verify a change to that rule is not to read it — it is to clone
    the repository somewhere else and run `cargo test`.

## Documentation

```shell
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open     # Rust API

pip install -r docs/requirements.txt        # the site
mkdocs serve                                # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
